# Restaurant Project
## Description
You've been asked to design a menu website for a new restaurant opening at 348 E Main St, Lexington, KY. The owners are busy working on their recipes and haven't picked a name yet, so they've asked you to suggest one and use it in your design.
The owners are still working on their recipes. They've populated an API with many possible choices. You are to use the API to generate a sample menu to add to your website. The API URL is: https://sheltered-refuge-85246.herokuapp.com/api/json
MVP
A single-page web app that serves as a restaurant splash page with a menu.

### Tech Stack
HTML
CSS
Bootstrap
JS
React
Process

## Setup
Plan out and pseudocode your project - see example kanban
Create GitHub repo Locally via NPX create-react-app
Create necessary files for the application in your terminal and view and modify them in your editor
NPM install and import/route necessary css/js libraries (E.g. Bootstrap, Axios, react-router-dom)
Save all and create your first commit to main, then switch to a dev branch
Application File Structure
See create-react-app.dev
Develop
Create a dev branch to commit your code to. Letâ€™s get in the habit of breaking things out into tickets, cutting a branch for that feature, creating a PR into dev, then merging and repeating.
Add content and elements to your website.
View changes and test in gitpod..
Save often, and commit to your feature branch on GitHub when important changes happen. Merge PR in, cut new feature branch.
Push your commits to GitHub remote.
For bug fixes, refactored code, and feature branches, you must create a branch off of dev, onto a new-feature branch and create a Pull Request back to dev when complete.
Deploy (Friday)
Create a Pull Request from dev into main
Confirm code is up to date and works correctly
Leave your code running on a node server or push it to Firebase.
Save the hosting link in your repo description and add it to your portfolio as an external link.
Submit your final working version

## Requirements
To complete the assignment, you must complete the following:
Generate the following information:
The restaurant's name (give it a good one!)
The restaurant's address
The restaurant's hours of operation
Access the API using Axios. Learn more
Create a dynamic restaurant menu
Choose a specific menu section type to display (Appetizers, Pasta, Sandwiches, etc)
Dynamically render at least 15 menu items.
The menu section you decide to display should have its own view as an organism (for example, a bootstrap accordion or nav tabs)
Each menu item must be a molecule (for example, using a bootstrap card or list item with a picture of the meal, as well as the name, and the price, etc)
Manage the React Component State
Additional Requirements
Website must be responsive
Website must be styled
Use the tools and technologies covered in class to complete your website.
Your repo should be public so that others can see your code and comment on it.
Remember to push to GitHub!
Potential employers will view your GitHub profile, so activity is crucial!

## Stretch Goals
Display multiple menu section types (Lunch, Dinner, Drinks, etc.)
Create an MVP assigning points to user stories using the Fibonacci method.
Use Reactstrap (npm package) for styling.
Modify your Title and Meta Tags using create-react-app.
Use NPM to embed a Google Map component showing the location of the restaurant.
Include a different 'specials' menu for each day of the week that the restaurant is open and show that menu based on the current day (should prove to work throughout the week) as well as what was on the specials menu yesterday/ what will be on the specials menu tomorrow.
Use React Context.
Parse the results of the API call to show a list of sides available for substitution (either in addition to or instead of listing sides with each entree). Show spicy level with some indication. Group by cuisine.
Implement DoorDash style online ordering with parent-child component state management and a 'shopping cart' to save data for purchase.
Write React Tests with create-react-app.

## Recommended NPM Packages (for when you refactor, not the first time around)
React-Bootstrap
Redux
React Virtualized
React Router
DayJS
Another instructor approved packaged from NPM

## If you finish early
Continue to add your own content, additions, and pages to your site and improve the styling.
